## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-600: Public scan function (Inspection) | _TODO_ | Removed: `scan()` convenience function was deleted when `ProjectScope` became mandatory. Use `scan_with_config()` (FR-601) instead. |
| TC-002 | FR-601: Configurable scan function (Test) | _TODO_ | `doc_engine::scan_with_config(path, &config)` respects `ScanConfig` fields and returns `Result<ScanReport, ScanError>` |
| TC-003 | FR-602: Public types (Inspection) | _TODO_ | All listed types are importable from `doc_engine::` |
