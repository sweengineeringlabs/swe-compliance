# Manual Test Execution: Spec File Parsing

> **TLDR:** Manual test checklist for Spec File Parsing — step-by-step procedures with expected outcomes.

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Pending
**Test Plan:** [Test Plan](spec_file_parsing.test)

## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-700: Dual-format spec file parsing (Test) | _TODO_ | Valid `.spec.yaml` files parse via serde_yaml; valid `.spec` markdown files have metadata extracted via regex; invalid files of either format produce a `SpecDiagnostic` with file path and error message |
| TC-002 | FR-701: Kind-based dispatch (Test) | _TODO_ | A YAML file with `kind: brd` deserializes to `BrdSpec`; `kind: feature_request` to `FeatureRequestSpec`; `kind: architecture` to `ArchSpec`; `kind: test_plan` to `TestSpec`; `kind: deployment` to `DeploySpec`. A markdown `.spec` file produces a `MarkdownSpec` with extracted metadata. |
| TC-003 | FR-702: Spec file discovery (Test) | _TODO_ | Given a project with spec files in `1-requirements/`, `3-design/`, `5-testing/`, and `6-deployment/`, all spec files of both formats are discovered, categorized by extension, and tagged with their format (YAML or markdown) |
| TC-004 | FR-703: Parse error reporting (Test) | _TODO_ | A YAML file with a syntax error produces a `SpecDiagnostic` containing the file path, line number (if available), and a descriptive error message. A markdown spec missing required metadata headers produces a `SpecDiagnostic`. |
| TC-005 | FR-704: Markdown spec metadata extraction (Test) | _TODO_ | A markdown `.spec` file with `**Version:** 0.1.0`, `**Status:** Draft`, and `**Related:** RS-001` headers has all three values extracted. A `.test` file with a `**Spec:**` header containing a linked name and path has the spec link extracted. |
| TC-006 | FR-705: Markdown test table parsing (Test) | _TODO_ | A `.test` file with a markdown table containing ` |
| TC-007 | FR-706: Feature stem matching (Test) | _TODO_ | Given `compiler_design.spec`, `compiler_design.arch`, `compiler_design.test`, `compiler_design.deploy`, all four files are linked as a single SDLC chain via the shared stem `compiler_design` |
