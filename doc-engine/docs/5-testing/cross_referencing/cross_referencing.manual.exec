## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-720: Dependency resolution (Test) | _TODO_ | A `.spec.yaml` with `dependencies: [{ref: "FR-002", file: "auth/signup.spec.yaml"}]` passes if the referenced file exists and contains the referenced ID; fails if it does not |
| TC-002 | FR-721: SDLC chain completeness (Test) | _TODO_ | A `.spec` with no matching `.test` produces a cross-ref diagnostic. A `.spec.yaml` with no matching `.test.yaml` produces a cross-ref diagnostic. Both formats are checked independently. |
| TC-003 | FR-722: BRD inventory accuracy (Test) | _TODO_ | A BRD with `specCount: 3` for domain "auth" but only 2 actual spec files produces a diagnostic; all `specs[].file` paths must resolve |
| TC-004 | FR-723: Test traceability (Test) | _TODO_ | A YAML test case with `verifies: "REQ-001"` passes if the linked spec contains that ID. A markdown `.test` table row with `Verifies` = `DESIGN-001` passes if the linked `.spec` defines that ID. |
| TC-005 | FR-724: Architecture traceability (Test) | _TODO_ | An `.arch.yaml` with `spec: "FR-001"` passes if a matching `.spec.yaml` exists. A markdown `.arch` with a `**Spec:**` header containing a linked spec name passes if the linked `.spec` file exists. |
| TC-006 | FR-725: Related documents resolution (Test) | _TODO_ | A spec with `relatedDocuments: ["../3-design/architecture.md"]` passes if the path resolves; fails if it does not |
| TC-007 | FR-726: Cross-reference report (Test) | _TODO_ | `CrossRefReport` contains categorized results (dependency, sdlc_chain, inventory, test_trace, arch_trace, related_docs) with pass/fail per check |
| TC-008 | FR-727: Opt-in spec checking (—) | _TODO_ | Superseded: IDs 54-68 are now phase artifact `file_exists` checks (FR-815). Spec checks use dedicated builtin handlers with their own IDs. |
