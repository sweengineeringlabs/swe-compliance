requirements:
- id: REQ-001
  sourceId: FR-800
  title: Module discovery strategy
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Test
  acceptance: Module discovery detects Rust (`Cargo.toml`), JavaScript/TypeScript (`package.json`), Python (`setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`), and Java (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle`) project manifests. Projects without recognized manifests produce Skip for all module-level checks.
- id: REQ-002
  sourceId: FR-801
  title: W3H detection scope
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Test
  acceptance: W3H validation uses flexible regex `(?i)^##\s*(what
- id: REQ-003
  sourceId: FR-802
  title: Module deployment check skip behavior
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Test
  acceptance: Module deployment checks produce Skip (not Fail) for modules that have no `docs/6-deployment/` directory. Only modules with an existing `docs/6-deployment/` directory are validated for required files (`README.md`, `prerequisites.md`, `installation.md`).
- id: REQ-004
  sourceId: FR-803
  title: Feature-prefixed artifact check opt-in
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Test
  acceptance: Feature naming checks produce Skip if no files or directories matching `FR_\d{3}` exist anywhere in the project. When FR-prefixed artifacts do exist, folders must match `FR_\d{3}/` and files must match `FR_\d{3}_.+`. Hyphens (`FR-###`) in file paths produce a warning.
- id: REQ-005
  sourceId: FR-804
  title: Planning phase artifact verification
  priority: Should
  status: Approved
  verification: Test
  acceptance: 'The tool shall verify that standard planning phase artifacts exist under `docs/2-planning/`: risk register (`risk_register.md`), estimation records (`estimation.md`), schedule (`schedule.md`), resource plan (`resource_plan.md`), communication plan (`communication_plan.md`), and quality plan (`quality_plan.md`). Each missing artifact produces an `info`-level finding. Schedule, resource plan, and communication plan are scoped to `open_source` projects only and produce `Skip` for internal projects.'
- id: REQ-006
  sourceId: FR-805
  title: SRS 29148 attribute validation
  priority: Should
  status: Approved
  verification: Test
  acceptance: 'Check 89 validates that every FR-xxx and NFR-xxx block in `docs/1-requirements/srs.md` contains the five mandatory ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 attributes: Priority, State, Verification, Traces to (or Traceability), and Acceptance. Missing attributes produce per-requirement violations. Projects without an SRS file or without FR/NFR blocks produce Skip. STK-xxx blocks are excluded (they use a consolidated table format).'
- id: REQ-007
  sourceId: FR-806
  title: Architecture 42010 attribute validation
  priority: Should
  status: Approved
  verification: Test
  acceptance: 'Check 90 validates that architecture documents at both project level (`docs/3-design/architecture.md`) and module level (`<module>/docs/3-design/architecture.md`) contain key ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 sections: stakeholder identification, architectural concerns/rationale, and viewpoints/views. Missing sections produce per-file violations. Projects and modules without an architecture file or with an empty file are skipped. If no architecture files exist anywhere, the check produces Skip. W3H sections (Who/Why/What/How) satisfy the 42010 requirements.'
- id: REQ-008
  sourceId: FR-807
  title: Testing 29119-3 attribute validation
  priority: Should
  status: Approved
  verification: Test

Missing sections produce per-file violations. Projects and modules without a testing strategy file or with an empty file are skipped. If no testing strategy files exist anywhere, the check produces Skip.'
