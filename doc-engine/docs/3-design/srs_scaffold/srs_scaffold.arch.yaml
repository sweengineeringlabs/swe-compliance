  description: 'When `--report <path>` is provided, the scaffold command shall serialize a `ScaffoldStatusReport` as pretty-printed JSON. The report wraps `ScaffoldResult` fields (promoted to top level) with ISO 15289:2019 clause 9 identification metadata: standard identifier, clause reference, tool name, tool version (from `Cargo.toml`), ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, canonicalized SRS source path, phase filter, and force flag. Parent directories are created automatically. No new dependencies are introduced — the timestamp uses Howard Hinnant''s `civil_from_days` algorithm on `std::time::SystemTime`.'
