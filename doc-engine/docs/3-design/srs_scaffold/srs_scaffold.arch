# Architecture: SRS Scaffold

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Spec:** [Feature Spec](../1-requirements/srs_scaffold/srs_scaffold.spec)

## Components

| Component | Traces To | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| FR-822 handler | STK-11 -> `main.rs`, `core/scaffold/mod.rs` | ``` |
| FR-823 handler | STK-11 -> `core/scaffold/parser.rs` | SRS domain extraction |
| FR-824 handler | STK-11 -> `core/scaffold/mod.rs`, `core/scaffold/yaml_gen.rs`, `core/scaffold/markdown_gen.rs` | Generated files per domain: |
| FR-825 handler | STK-11 -> `core/scaffold/markdown_gen.rs` | Manual test execution plan |
| FR-826 handler | STK-11 -> `core/scaffold/markdown_gen.rs` | Automated test execution plan |
| FR-827 handler | STK-11 -> `core/scaffold/mod.rs` | Scaffold skip/force behavior |
| FR-828 handler | STK-11 -> `main.rs` | Scaffold output directory |
| FR-829 handler | STK-11 -> `main.rs`, `core/scaffold/mod.rs`, `core/scaffold/types.rs` | Scaffold phase filter |
| FR-830 handler | STK-11 -> `main.rs`, `core/scaffold/types.rs` | When `--report <path>` is provided, the scaffold command shall serialize a `ScaffoldStatusReport` as pretty-printed JSON. The report wraps `ScaffoldResult` fields (promoted to top level) with ISO 15289:2019 clause 9 identification metadata: standard identifier, clause reference, tool name, tool version (from `Cargo.toml`), ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, canonicalized SRS source path, phase filter, and force flag. Parent directories are created automatically. No new dependencies are introduced — the timestamp uses Howard Hinnant's `civil_from_days` algorithm on `std::time::SystemTime`. |
