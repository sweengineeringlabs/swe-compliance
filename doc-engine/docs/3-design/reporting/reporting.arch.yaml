components:
- name: FR-400 handler
  tracesTo: STK-05 -> `core/reporter.rs`
  description: Default output shall be human-readable text grouped by category, showing check ID, description, pass/fail/skip, violations with file paths, and a summary line.
- name: FR-401 handler
  tracesTo: STK-03 -> `core/reporter.rs`
  description: When `--json` is provided, output shall be a JSON `ScanReport`.
- name: FR-402 handler
  tracesTo: STK-03 -> `main.rs`
  description: Exit codes
- name: FR-403 handler
  tracesTo: STK-09 -> `main.rs`
  description: When `--output` / `-o` is provided, the engine shall persist the scan report as JSON to the given file path, regardless of whether `--json` was specified for stdout. Parent directories are created automatically. Stdout output is unaffected. If the file cannot be written, the tool exits with code 2.
- name: FR-831 handler
  tracesTo: STK-09 -> `main.rs`, `core/reporter.rs`
  description: 'When `--output <path>` is provided, the scan command shall serialize an `AuditStatusReport` as pretty-printed JSON. The report wraps `ScanReport` fields (promoted to top level) with ISO 15289:2019 clause 9.2 identification metadata: standard identifier, clause reference, tool name, tool version (from `Cargo.toml`), ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, and canonicalized project root path. The `--json` stdout output is unaffected and continues to emit the bare `ScanReport`. No new dependencies are introduced.'
