kind: feature_request
domain: Maintainability
section: '5.4'
requirements:
- id: REQ-001
  sourceId: NFR-400
  title: Component-based architecture
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Inspection
  acceptance: The frontend UI is organized into self-contained components (dashboard, violations, scaffold, editor, templates, ai, specs, struct-engine); the backend API is organized into route modules matching the domain structure; no circular dependencies exist between components
- id: REQ-002
  sourceId: NFR-401
  title: API-first design
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Inspection
  acceptance: Every UI operation is backed by a documented REST or WebSocket API endpoint; no functionality is available only through the UI; the API can be consumed by external clients (CI systems, scripts) independently of the web UI
- id: REQ-003
  sourceId: NFR-402
  title: Engine version compatibility
  priority: Must
  status: Proposed
  verification: Test
  acceptance: The frontend server declares doc-engine and struct-engine crates as Cargo dependencies with semver-compatible version constraints; the `/health` endpoint reports the linked engine versions; incompatible engine API changes are detected at compile time
