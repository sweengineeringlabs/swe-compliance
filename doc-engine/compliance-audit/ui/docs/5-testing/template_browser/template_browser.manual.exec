## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-600: List templates (Test) | Run `GET /api/v1/templates` | Returns a JSON array of template objects with name, sdlc_phase, description, and path fields; the list includes all templates from the configured template-engine templates directory |
| TC-002 | FR-601: Template preview with W3H structure (Demonstration) | Navigate to the template browser, select a template from the list, and switch between rendered and raw code views | Selecting a template displays its rendered markdown with W3H sections (WHO, WHAT, WHY, HOW) visually highlighted; the raw markdown is also available in a code view |
| TC-003 | FR-602: Template copy to project (Test) | Run `POST /api/v1/templates/{name}/copy` | With `{"project_id": "uuid", "target_path": "docs/2-planning/quality_plan.md"}` copies the template to the project's directory; returns 201 on success or 409 if file already exists |
| TC-004 | FR-603: Compliance checklist display (Demonstration) | Navigate to the template browser, select a project with a completed doc-engine scan, and open the compliance checklist view | The template browser includes a dedicated checklist view that displays the 56-point compliance checklist from template-engine with each item's status (pass/fail/skip) mapped to the most recent doc-engine scan results for the selected project |
