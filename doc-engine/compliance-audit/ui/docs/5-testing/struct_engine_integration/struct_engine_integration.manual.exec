## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-1100: Struct-engine scan results (Test) | Run `GET /api/v1/scans/{id}` | For a struct-engine scan returns the struct-engine `ScanReport` JSON (containing results with check_id, category, description, result per check across 7 categories: structure, cargo_metadata, cargo_targets, naming, test_org, documentation, hygiene) |
| TC-002 | FR-1101: Crate layout visualization (Demonstration) | Run a struct-engine scan to completion on a Rust project, then navigate to the struct-engine results page and inspect the crate layout tree | The struct-engine results page includes a tree diagram showing the project's actual crate layout (src/, main/, tests/, benches/, examples/) with pass/fail indicators overlaid on directories that correspond to checked paths |
| TC-003 | FR-1102: Project kind display (Demonstration) | Navigate to the struct-engine results page for a completed scan and locate the project kind indicator | The struct-engine results display the detected project kind (Library, Binary, Both, Workspace) and indicate which checks were skipped due to kind filtering |
