## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-500: Upload SRS document (Test) | Run `POST /api/v1/scaffold/parse` | With the SRS markdown content in the request body returns a JSON representation of extracted domains and requirements (matching `SrsDomain` and `SrsRequirement` structures: section, title, slug, requirements with id, title, kind, priority, state, verification, traces_to, acceptance, description) |
| TC-002 | FR-501: Scaffold preview (Demonstration) | Upload an SRS markdown document via `POST /api/v1/scaffold/parse`, then click "Preview Scaffold" in the scaffold UI | After uploading an SRS, the UI displays a tree of files that will be generated: per-domain `.spec.yaml`, `.spec`, `.arch.yaml`, `.arch`, `.test.yaml`, `.test`, `.manual.exec`, `.auto.exec`, `.deploy.yaml`, `.deploy`, plus BRD files; each file shows its target path under the output directory |
| TC-003 | FR-502: Execute scaffold (Test) | Run `POST /api/v1/scaffold/execute` | With `{"project_id": "uuid", "srs_content": "...", "phases": ["requirements", "testing"], "force": false}` invokes `scaffold_from_srs()` and returns a `ScaffoldResult` JSON (standard, clause, tool, tool_version, timestamp, srs_source, phases, force, domain_count, requirement_count, created, skipped) |
| TC-004 | FR-503: Phase and type filters (Test) | In the scaffold UI, toggle SDLC phase checkboxes (requirements, design, testing, deployment) and file type checkboxes (yaml, spec, arch, test, exec, deploy), then run `POST /api/v1/scaffold/execute` with the selected filters | The scaffold UI provides checkboxes for SDLC phases (requirements, design, testing, deployment) and file types (yaml, spec, arch, test, exec, deploy); selections are passed to `ScaffoldConfig.phases` and `ScaffoldConfig.file_types` |
| TC-005 | FR-504: Scaffold progress monitoring (Demonstration) | Click "Generate" in the scaffold UI and observe the real-time file creation log during execution | During scaffold execution, the UI displays which files are being created (`+` prefix) and which are skipped (`~` prefix) in real-time; upon completion, a summary shows domain_count, requirement_count, created count, and skipped count |
