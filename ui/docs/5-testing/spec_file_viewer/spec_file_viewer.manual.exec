## Test Cases

| TC | Test | Steps | Expected |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| TC-001 | FR-1000: Browse spec files (Test) | Run `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/specs` | Returns a JSON array of discovered spec files with path, format (yaml/markdown), kind (brd/spec/architecture/test_plan/deployment), and domain_slug fields; the UI displays them in a tree grouped by domain |
| TC-002 | FR-1001: Spec file content view (Demonstration) | Navigate to the spec file viewer, expand a domain node in the tree, and select both a `.spec.yaml` file and a `.spec` markdown file | Selecting a spec file displays its content: YAML files are rendered with syntax highlighting; markdown files are rendered as formatted HTML; both views show the file's metadata (Version, Status, Spec ID, Related) in a summary header |
| TC-003 | FR-1002: Cross-reference display (Demonstration) | In the spec file viewer, open a test plan (`.test.yaml`) containing `verifies` fields and a spec with dependency references, then click the cross-reference links | The spec viewer shows cross-references as navigable links: clicking a dependency reference navigates to the referenced spec file; test plan `verifies` fields link to the corresponding requirement spec; unresolved references are highlighted in red |
| TC-004 | FR-1003: BRD inventory display (Demonstration) | Navigate to the spec file viewer and open the BRD overview page | The spec viewer includes a BRD overview page showing the master inventory: domain count, specs per domain, and coverage indicators for each SDLC phase (requirements, design, testing, deployment) |
