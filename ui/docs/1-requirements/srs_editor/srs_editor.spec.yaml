  acceptance: '`POST /api/v1/editor/validate` with SRS markdown content invokes `parse_srs()` and returns validation results: `{"valid": true|false, "domains": N, "requirements": N, "errors": [...]}` where errors include missing attribute table fields, duplicate FR IDs, and malformed section headings'

  status: Proposed
  verification: Demonstration
  acceptance: When the user types `#### FR-` in a new domain section, the editor suggests the next sequential FR ID based on the domain's numbering range (e.g., FR-201 if the domain starts at FR-200 and FR-200 exists); accepting the suggestion inserts the complete requirement header with an empty attribute table

  acceptance: '`PUT /api/v1/projects/{id}/srs` with SRS markdown content saves the document to the project''s `docs/1-requirements/srs.md` path; `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/srs` returns the current SRS content with 200, or 404 if no SRS exists'
